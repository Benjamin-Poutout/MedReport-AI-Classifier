## Extracting Entities ##

To generate the extraction through LLMs of entities, you can simply run :

```bash
cd /3.Generating
python entities_gen.py
```

Make sure first to copy the data in [Data_Extracting_Entities](https://github.com/Benjamin-Poutout/MedReport-AI-Classifier/blob/main/2.Data/Data_Extracting_Entities/inference_data.json) inside of [Generating](https://github.com/Benjamin-Poutout/MedReport-AI-Classifier/tree/main/3.Generating) before running the code.
